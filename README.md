# MarchingAlgorithm
An algorithm to obtain two-phase pressure profile and flow-regime along the well

main3.m :
Calculate the flowing wellhead pressure using the
marching algorithm with the Poettmann and Carpenter and the Fancher and Brown correlations.
Consider 20 length increments for your calculations. The well data are as follows:
QOil=500 STB/D
Qw=200STB/D
RP=1000 scf/STBO
D=1.995 in
Depth=4000 ft
P=3000 psia at Depth
Average T =130ºF
e=0.0006

main4.m :
Use the Beggs and Brill correlation to simulate an isothermal two phase flow in a
vertical oil well and determine:

1- the two phase flow pattern along the well column.

2- the variation of liquid hold up in the production tubing.

3- the profile of pressure in well.

Consider at least 20 length increments for your calculations. The well data are as follows:

QOil=10,000 STB/D RP=1,000 scf/STBO d= 1.995 in μL= 0.97 cp μg= 0.016 cp
σL= 8.41 dyns/cm e=0.00006 ft well depth=4000 ft bottom hole P=1700 psia
Average T =180ºF gas gravity=0.75 API=30
